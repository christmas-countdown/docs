# Timezones

## Server timezones

:::note
  If you have an international community it is better to leave the timezone as the default (`UTC`).
:::

The server timezone will be used for the automatic countdown, and as a default for commands if a user does not have a personal timezone set.

Type `/server set timezone:` followed by your preferred [timezone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

## User timezones

Your user timezone overrides the server's timezone when using commands.

Type `/user set timezone:` followed by your preferred [timezone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).
