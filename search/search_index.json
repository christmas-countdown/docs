Commands use the user's locale if one is set, and otherwise use the server's locale (default is en-GB ). Similarly, commands in the Christmas category use the user's timezone if one is set, and otherwise use the server's timezone (default is UTC ). In most cases, hyphens in command names/aliases can be omitted (eg: total-days -> totaldays ), and spaces for sub commands can also be omitted (eg: server set -> serverset ). It works with or without. If you make a mistake when typing a command, instead of re-typing it, you can edit your previous message and the bot will respond to the new message content. Using x!help [command] will give you information about a command. Some commands have examples as part of the additional information.
